When approaching software design, I start by understanding the problem thoroughly by defining clear requirements. After brainstorming what the end goal experience should be, I begin working bit by bit. Through working on my projects, I've honed skills in graphic and architectural design, ensuring that my software is modular and maintainable. I am a champion of iterative development, where I create prototypes, gather feedback, and iterate on designs to improve them. In future work, I plan to apply tactics like modularization and abstraction to continue with easy code maintenance. 
I take an incremental approach when developing programs, breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. Throughout my work on the 3D scene(by way of the different project folders per module), I used strategies like version control, unit testing, and continuous integration and improvement. Iteration has been vital to my development process, allowing me to refine features and fix bugs progressively. Any feedback provided by Professor Gray was implemented in subsequent works.
Computer science offers valuable tools to help me reach my education and professional goals. Computational graphics and visualizations have equipped me with new knowledge and skills that are applicable across various educational and professional avenues. Through hands-on experience with graphics programming, I've gained a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts like vectors, transformations, and rasterization. These skills can enhance my future educational pursuits by enabling me to tackle complex problems in burgeoning fields like data visualization. I also recognize that proficiency in computational graphics opens up opportunities in as game development, computer-aided design, virtual reality, and augmented reality.
